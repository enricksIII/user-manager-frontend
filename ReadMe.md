# Documentation for A User Management System

## The User Management System was built using the React Library due to the time constraints, the ease of building using components went a long way in the structure of the application.

## The json-server library was also leveraged as a mock for a backend service. Effective but limited in some aspects.

## The bootstrap library was also used for easy and fast styling.

## clone or download the zipped version of the repo to get the files, and then run npm-install inside the root folder to install all the required dependencies.


## To run the application, you need to have Node.js, at least version 8 upwards installed. You need to start both the json server and the React server. The json-server should be the first server to be run so that all data can be accessible once the React server is started.

## Open separate command line interfaces for each of the servers

### To start the json-server, cd to the root directory of the cloned repo and then run 'npm run json:server'

### To start the react server, access the root directory of the cloned repo on a separate command line interface and then run 'npm run dev-server'

## You can access the application on the browser by visiting 'http://localhost:8080'
